# Hello, Git!

This is my [*first project on GitHub](https://github.com/technoid583/git-test-repo). I'm learning Git and creating my 'hello git' web page.

I've learned all about Git/GitHub from YouTube. In the videos that I'm referring to, everything related to the Git version control system has been taught. On the web page, you can find all the commands from the playlist that I've learned. Check it out!

Feel free to check out the code, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or feedback!
